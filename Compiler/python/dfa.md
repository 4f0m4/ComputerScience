## Summary
The code simulates a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts strings ending with "01". It defines the DFA structure, including states and transitions, then uses a function to process input strings.

1. **DFA Structure**: The DFA is represented as a dictionary, where keys are states and values are dictionaries mapping input symbols to next states.
   
2. **Simulation Function**: The `simulate_dfa` function tracks the current state as it processes each symbol of the input string. It updates the state based on transitions defined in the DFA.

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: After processing the string, it checks if the final state is in the set of accept states.

4. **Example Strings**: Two example strings are tested:
   - The first string (`'1011111000011'`) is accepted because it ends with "01".
   - The second string (`'101111100001101'`) is not accepted as it does not end with "01".

The results of the tests are printed as "accepted" or "NotAccepted".

        if symbol in dfa[current_state]:

            current_state = dfa[current_state][symbol]
        else:
            # If the DFA does not have a transition, reject the string
            return False

    # If the final state is an accept state, accept the string
    if current_state in accept_states:
        return True
    else:

        return False
