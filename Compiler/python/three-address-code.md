## Summary

The code converts C++ assignment statements into three-address code, which simplifies expressions for easier processing. It uses regular expressions to identify assignments of the form `variable = expression;`. For each assignment, it creates a temporary variable to hold the result of the expression and then assigns that temporary variable to the original variable. The example usage shows how it processes multiple C++ lines, generating corresponding three-address code outputs.

## Code

```
import re

def generate_three_address_code(cpp_code):
    three_address_code = []
    temp_count = 1

    for line in cpp_code:
        # Example: int a = b + c;
        match = re.match(r'\s*(\w+)\s*=\s*([\w\s+*/-]+)\s*;', line)
        if match:
            result, operation = match.groups()
            temp_var = f"temp{temp_count}"
            temp_count += 1

            three_address_code.append(f"{temp_var} = {operation}")
            three_address_code.append(f"{result} = {temp_var}")

    return three_address_code

# Example usage
cpp_instructions = [
    "a = b + c;",
    "x = y * z;",
    "if (p < q) {",
    "   r = s - t;",
    "} else {",
    "   u = v / w;",
    "}"
]

three_address_code_result = generate_three_address_code(cpp_instructions)

# Print the generated three-address code
for code_line in three_address_code_result:
    print(code_line)

```
